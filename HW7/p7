	File p7:  an example of a standard Quintus Prolog "front end" program
	which adds "not" and list processing to the language, loads a puzzle
	description which uses these extensions, and solves it.

	Other versions, like SWI-Prolog, generally have these libraries included
	by default, so this front-end code is not required.
