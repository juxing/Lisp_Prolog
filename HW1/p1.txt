CS 580							Due: Feb. 5Spring 2014De Jong				Homework #1You are to become familiar with the basic symbol manipulation and list processing features of Lisp by extending the sample p0.lsp code to produce permutation products.  For example, if X is one set of permutations, and Y is another set of permutations, then the product permutation X*Y is the set of all pairs (x y) where x is a permutation from X and y is a permutation from Y.  For example, if X = perm(a b) and Y = perm(c d), then X*Y is:
			((a b) (c d)) 			((a b) (d c)) 			((b a) (c d)) 			((b a) (d c))Your program should read permutation product problems from p1.dat and exhaustively enumerate the permutation products in the same manner as p0.lsp.  Permutation product problems will take the following form in p1.dat:	( (a b) (1 2 3) )	( (x y z) (1 2) (now is the time) )	...Your program should make no assumptions about the number of symbols in a particular permutation or the number of sets in the product.Requirements:1. Capture the output of a Lisp session in which you successfully load and execute your code on p1.dat.2.  In addition, you are to send to cs580ta.cs.gmu.edu  the following email:   - the subject field of the email should read: CS580  HW #1
   - the content of the email should be:
	Your name	CS580	Homework #1        (A short summary of the status of your program:  what's working, what's not, any issues, problems, ...)

   - your email should have 3 attachments:   	- p1.lsp, your Lisp code for HW1, which must be commented and start out with:		; Your name		; CS580		; Homework #1
	- p1.dat
	- p1.out, your captured Lisp sessionAs a safety precaution, always cc yourself when you submit homework this way and keep it around until it has been graded and returned.
